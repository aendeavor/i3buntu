# Documentation of scripts

## Variables

In the installation script, variables are named consistently. Therefore, variables with the same name get the same job.

``` sh
# directory of the executed script, absolute and normalized
DIR

BACK
# location of the backup directory

LOG
# location of the logfile
```

## Markdown

Comments in markdown are achieved vie

``` MARKDOWN
[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)
```
