= Security Policy

== Supported Versions

Currently, there are **no versions where explicite security support is being given to users**. This will not change, as this repository is a conglomeration of software, for which each distributor may give their own security policy and security support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

A vulnerability of software used in this repository is to be reported on the distributor's page.
